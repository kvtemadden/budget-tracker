## Functionality
When visiting the landing page, a user will see a blank graph on their initial visit, a total and a form fill area.

This form allows users to input either an increase or decrease in their current budget.

The changes in budget will then be added to the graph, which allows someone to see any peaks or troughs in their current budget spend.

As the budget tracker may be used by a certain demographic, e.g. travellers, the user will be able to use the tracker whilst it's offline but notice no difference.

Their spend will then be added back onto the database meaning it'll be recalled for when they return to the app.
